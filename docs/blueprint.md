- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text
- Pixel-art icons to complement the retro arcade theme. They should be bold, simple and easily recognizable, using colors from the app’s palette.

- Use silly, cartoonish animations for easter eggs and chaotic triggers, such as glitch effects, gravity flips, and random object spawns.
